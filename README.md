# anomoly-detection

Our Project aims at improving field of automated anomaly detection in security surveillance systems by a novel 
approach of combining advanced video compression or encoders to decrease the computational burden with deep 
learning techniques. We are doing this to implement the project in real time environment. This could make security 
systems faster and more accurate, allowing them to quickly spot and respond to threats without needing as much 
processing power. By reducing the computational demands typically associated with processing large amounts of live 
video data, our project could pave the way for more accessible and scalable security solutions, influencing the design 
of next-generation surveillance technologies and smart monitoring systems.
